## higher order functions
assert message bolen
and
higer order functions like a general rule and similarity
pow(k,3)   指数函数 
avoid repeat ourselves
higher order function definiation : a function that takes other functions as an argument or return value
use mul pow may be easier
def f:
    def f2:
        return 
    return f2

function can be return value

def make_adder(n):
    def adder(k):
        return n + k
    return adder

lambda x: x * x
there is no return no statement  but wonderful
def gives a intrinsic
look at it for some while to search for a simpler way
in python avoid use if(f,a,a) 
return chapter is not clear
return x>0 and sqrt(x) > 100  or and 防止短路
<cons> if <pre> else <alt>
Instead of listing formal parameters for a function, you can write *args, which represents all of the arguments that get passed into the function. We can then call another function with these same arguments by passing these *args into this other function.

sometimes lambda is truly better than def
lambda y: lambda x: search(f(x)=y)
newton method
lambda 拆开更适合阅读

every local frame has its parent frame which is often the global frame
self-reference
def print_all(x):
    print(x)
